# Guidelines and recommendation on how to write your thesis (work in progress!)

## Document formatting

* If you write your thesis using \LaTeX, make sure to use a [document class](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure) that allows the use of **Chapters**. The most standard class for this is **book**
* Make sure that chapters, sections, subsections and subsubsections are numbered so that it's easy to reference them throughout the thesis
* Include tables and figures close to where you first introduce them, and not at the end of a chapter. In this way, it should be easier for the reader to find such tables and figures when you explain their contents in the main text
* Always refer to tables and figures with "Table 3", "Figure 2" and similar to avoid ambiguity about which figure/table you are talking about
* Use an author-year citation style for your references. See [this document](https://github.com/mirkosignorelli/info4supervisions/blob/main/formatting_references.md) for more information about how to do this

## Structuring your thesis

The way in which you structure contents in your thesis is largely dependent on what your thesis is about. A starting point could be the following:

1. Introduction - a section where you define the problem you are going to work on
2. Methods
3. Simulation studies
4. Applications
5. Conclusion / discussion

This, however, is a rather generic backbone, and you most likely will want to adapt it to your work. We can discuss together how to best structure your thesis!

## Readibility

Keep in mind that the examiner(s) will have a limited amount of time to read and evaluate your thesis. For this reason, it is important that your thesis is well-structured, and that things are explained as clearly as possible and in a concise manner. Some suggestions:

* **never use an abbreviation before having defined it**: define the abbreviation at its first occurrence, and use the abbreviation consistently thereafter;
* **define the meaning of the mathematical notations you use**, and do so at their first occurrence. Keep in mind that the reader may not be familiar with the type of notation you use!
* **keep it short and to the point**: since he/she will have a limited amount of time to read your thesis, the examiner will appreciate it if you can explain things coincisely and  avoid to provide information that is not relevant to your work / too many unnecessary details;
* **proofread what you write**, and ask yourself: is that grammatically correct, and clear?
* avoid as much as possible long sentences which may be hard to read;
* make use of bulleted lists to organize complex chunks of information, rather than sticking everyting in a long inline paragraph.
