# Guidelines and recommendation on how to write your thesis (work in progress!)

## Document formatting

* If you write your thesis using \LaTeX, make sure to use a [document class](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure) that allows the use of **Chapters**. The most standard class for this is **book**
* Make sure that chapters, sections, subsections and subsubsections are numbered so that it's easy to reference them throughout the thesis
* Include tables and figures close to where you first introduce them, and not at the end of a chapter. In this way, it should be easier for the reader to find such tables and figures when you explain their contents in the main text
* Always refer to tables and figures with "Table 3", "Figure 2" and similar to avoid ambiguity about which figure/table you are talking about
* Use an author-year citation style for your references. See [this document](https://github.com/mirkosignorelli/info4supervisions/blob/main/formatting_references.md) for more information about how to do this

## Structuring your thesis

The way in which you structure contents in your thesis is largely dependent on what your thesis is about. A starting point could be the following:

1. Introduction - a section where you define the problem you are going to work on
2. Methods
3. Simulation studies
4. Applications
5. Conclusion / discussion

This, however, is a rather generic backbone, and you most likely will want to adapt it to your work. We can discuss together how to best structure your thesis!
