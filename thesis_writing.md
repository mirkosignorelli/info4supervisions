# Guidelines and recommendation on how to write your thesis

## Document formatting

* If you write your thesis using \LaTeX, make sure to use a [document class](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure) that allows the use of **Chapters**. The most standard class for this is **book**
* Make sure that chapters, sections, subsections and subsubsections are numbered so that it's easy to reference them throughout the thesis
* Use an author-year citation style for your references. See [this document](https://github.com/mirkosignorelli/info4supervisions/blob/main/formatting_references.md) for more information about how to do this
