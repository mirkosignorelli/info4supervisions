# Information about supervision of research projects for bachelor and master students

This repository contains a few documents that are meant to facilitate and streamline some parts of my supervisions of bachelor and master students. Note that this folder is currently **work in progress**.

## Supervision requests

Are you interested in doing your thesis project with me? If so, please check out:

1. this document that explains [what to include in your supervision request](https://github.com/mirkosignorelli/info4supervisions/blob/main/supervision_request.md);
2. [my personal website](https://mirkosignorelli.github.io) to get an idea of my research interests and past work.

## Formatting references

Please use an **author-year** citation stile for references in your project proposal and thesis. [Check out this document](https://github.com/mirkosignorelli/info4supervisions/blob/main/formatting_references.md) for more tips and recommendations about how to manage references and bibliographies.

## Writing your thesis

Writing a thesis is a process that spans over weeks or months, and it's a process that is hard to standardize. Nevertheless, here I have tried to gather some [guidelines that can help make your thesis well-structured and more readable](https://github.com/mirkosignorelli/info4supervisions/blob/main/thesis_writing.md).
