# What to include in your supervision request

## Foreword

Whether it's for a bachelor or a master thesis project, a supervision requires a substantial amount of work (both for the student, and the supervisor) that usually spans over months. For this reason, **it is important for me to make sure that I am in possession of as much relevant information as possible about the student I will be working with before we decide whether we want to commit to a supervision relationship**. The reason why I ask you to provide me with such information is to ensure that there is a good match between your background and preparation and the research project, so that we can **minimize the risk of dropouts or delays**.

Please keep in mind that I typically receive more supervision requests than I can possibly accommodate, and for this reason I sometimes have to turn supervision requests down. This is also why I take supervision requests seriously, and I ask you to provide me with the information listed below.

## What to include in your supervision request

When submitting a supervision request, please make sure to include the following information:

1. your **name, surname and student number**
2. the **name of your bachelor / master programme**
3. if you are a master student: what did you study in your bachelor?
4. **number of ECs** assigned to the project and expected duration
5. your **research interests**: are there specific topics, either methodological or applied, that you would like to explore?
6. a **list of exams you have already passed** (inclusive of grades)
7. a **list of courses that you have followed / are following**, for which you have not yet done / passed an exam
8. whether you would be available for **in person / hybrid supervision meetings**, or whether you require a **fully online supervision**

Please send your request to my work email address, which you can find [here](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/mirko-signorelli#tab-1). It may be convenient to include (6) and (7) as attachments (for example, as sheets of a spreadsheet).

Thank you for your interest in me as possible supervisor, and for taking the time to write a comprehensive supervision request!
