# What to include in your supervision request

## Foreword

Whether it's for a bachelor or a master thesis project, a supervision requires a substantial amount of work that usually spans over months. For this reason, it is important for me to make sure that I am in possession of as much relevant information as possible about the student I will be working with before we decide whether we want to commit to a supervision relationship. The reason why I ask you to provide me with such information is to ensure that there is a good match between the student's background and preparation and the research project, so that we can minimize the risk of dropouts or delays.

## What to include in your supervision request

When submitting a supervision request, please make sure to include the following information:

1. your **name, surname and student number**
2. the **name of your bachelor / master programme**
3. if you are a master student: what did you study in your bachelor?
4. **number of ECs** assigned to the project
5. what are **your research interests**: are there a specific topics, either methodological or applied, that you would like to explore?
6. a **list of exams you have already passed** (inclusive of grades)
7. a **list of courses that you have followed / are following**, for which you have not yet done / passed an exam
8. whether you would be available for **in person / hybrid supervision meetings**, or whether you require a **fully online supervision**

Please keep in mind that I typically receive more supervision requests than I can possibly accommodate, and thus I sometimes have to turn supervision requests down.
