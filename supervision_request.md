# What to include in your supervision request

Whether it's for a bachelor or a master thesis project, a supervision requires a substantial amount of work that usually spans over months. For this reason, it is important for me to make sure that I am in possession of as much relevant information as possible about the student I will be working with before we decide whether we want to commit to a supervision relationship. The reason why I ask you to provide me with such information is to ensure that there is a good match between the student's background and preparation and the research project, so that we can minimize the risk of dropouts or delays.

Please keep in mind that I typically receive more supervision requests than I can possibly accommodate, and thus I sometimes have to turn supervision requests down.
