# Recommendations and suggestions on reference formatting for project proposals and theses

## 1) Request: use author-year citation styles

Citation styles can be cathegorized into two groups: those that reference bibliographic resources using **the name of the first author and year of publication** ([here is an example](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssc.12234)), and those that use a **sequential number** ([here is another example](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.9178)).

Personally, as a reader I find that **author-year** citation styles make documents easier to read: if I see the name of the first author and year of publication in the text, I may already be familiar with that publication and understand what is being referenced. This is not possible with numbered referencing: in that case, for each reference I would need to scroll the document until the bibliography to find out what is being referenced.

Therefore, I would like to ask you to **use author-year citation styles in your project proposal and thesis**. You are free to choose the specific citation style you want to use among the many available author-citation styles, but if you would like a suggestion, **my recommentation is to use the APA citation style**, which was developed by the American Psychological Association.

## 2) Suggestion: use a dedicated tool to manage your bibliography and the citation style

Managing references and citation styles is a tedious task. Luckily, it can be easily automated. Here is how you can do it by using \LaTeX and \BibTeX:
